    question: "How much time does this routine actually take each night?",
    answer:
      "The full routine takes about 90 minutes, but we also include a 30-minute condensed version for busy nights. Most men find they naturally settle into something between 45-60 minutes once they get the hang of it. Think of it this way you're probably already spending that time lying awake frustrated anyway.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What if my schedule is too unpredictable for a consistent routine?",
    answer:
      "We built this for real life, not perfect conditions. The program includes micro-routines and backup plans for chaotic evenings, travel, and family interruptions. Even doing 3-4 steps consistently beats doing nothing perfectly.",
  },
  {
    question: "I've tried everything already. How is this different?",
    answer:
      "Most sleep advice treats all men the same. This targets the specific hormonal and stress changes that hit men after 35. We're not giving you generic tips we're addressing why your cortisol stays high when it should drop at night.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will this make me dependent on a complicated routine?",
    answer:
      "No. By week 4, you'll know which parts work best for your body. The goal is to build 3-4 habits that become automatic, not to stay locked into a rigid system forever.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my partner thinks this is too much or gets annoyed?",
    answer:
      "We include partner-friendly versions of every technique. Most partners actually love seeing their spouse take charge of their health and become less irritable from better sleep.",
  },
  {
    question: "I don't want to take supplements or pills. Do I have to?",
    answer:
      "The core routine uses zero supplements. We mention a few optional, natural options like magnesium, but the system works through light, temperature, breathing, and stress management alone.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly will I see results?",
    answer:
      "Most men notice easier sleep onset within the first week. By week 2, you should see fewer middle of the night wake ups. Full transformation sleeping 7+ hours consistently typically happens by week 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I travel frequently for work?",
    answer:
      "We include a complete travel section with hotel room setups, airplane strategies, and time zone adjustments. The core techniques work anywhere you have 30 minutes before bed.",
  },
  {
    question: "I work late or have shift work. Will this still work?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We cover shift workers and irregular schedules in the special situations module. The key is consistency with your personal rhythm, not the clock time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's your guarantee?",
    answer:
      "If you don't sleep at least 7 hours for 5 nights per week by the end of 4 weeks, we'll refund every penny. No questions asked. We're that confident this works for professional men your age.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "I'm worried about looking high-maintenance or weak for needing help with sleep.",
    answer:
      "Elite athletes optimize recovery. Top executives optimize everything that affects performance. Taking your sleep seriously isn't weakness it's what separates champions from burnouts.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I start strong but lose motivation after a few days?",
    answer:
      "The program is designed with this in mind. Week 1 gives you quick wins to build momentum. The tracking sheets show your progress clearly. Plus, once you feel the difference in your energy and sharpness, motivation takes care of itself.",
  },
